# HSI_PC_Enrichment
Enrichment of 3D Point Cloud using Hyperspectral Imaging



To Do:
- Get the size of each pixel from the HSI
- Orient the HSI image to the PC
- Segment vertices that are not covered by the HSI (Ray Casting)
- Set the voxel size to each pixel
- Voxelise vertice hit by ray cast from the pixel normal. 
- Apply HSI info from pixel to voxel.
- Transform all RGB to Lab values, then do DeltaEab.
- Visualize color difference for each vertex in the voxel.
